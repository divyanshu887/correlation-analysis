# Correlation analysis
We have a dataset which contains information of new born babies and their parents.It contains mostly continuous variables (although some have only a few values e.g. number of cigarettes smoked per day).  
From this datatset we have analysed the correalation between the following variables -
- Maternal height and baby length.
- Gestation and baby weight.
- Motherâ€™s pre-pregnancy weight and baby weight.
